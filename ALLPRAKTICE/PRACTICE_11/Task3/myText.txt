Lord Thomas he was a bold forester
The chaser of the King's deer
Fair Eleanor she was a fair woman
Lord Thomas he loved her dear
Come riddle, my riddle, dear mother, he said
And riddle us both as one
Whether I shall marry with fair Ellinor
And let the brown-girl alone
The brown girl she has got houses and lands
Fair Ellinor she has got none
Therefore I charge you on my blessing
To bring me the brown girl home var
